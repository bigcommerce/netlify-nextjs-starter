## Let's Get Started! 
<br/>

1. Step One: ‚úÖ You're here! The first step is being in this repo and hitting the "Deploy to Netlify" button at the bottom of this ReadME. <br/>

1. You need a BigCommerce store! Login or Sign Up to set up a new BigCommerce store to use! Once you've logged in or signed up, follow [these instrucitons](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Store-API-Accounts?language=en_US#creating) to obtain your BigCommerce API credentials. <br/>


1. Next, create an account or login to [ContentStack](https://app.contentstack.com/?_gl=1*2rimkv*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE2NjU3MDM5NDMuQ2p3S0NBanc3cDZhQmhCaUVpd0E4M2ZHdXNVa1RHRTdOWjZaQ0RoVWJEbjVNMm1odTAwQzRiOW52SDRoZEp2eHJnTGdXYlFLQllLOE1Cb0NPdzBRQXZEX0J3RQ..#!/login). 

1. Create a "Stack" by selecting "+ New Stack", title it, add a description, and click "Create". <br/>

1. Now that your Stack has been created, let's identify your API keys. Navigate to 
    the "Settings" icon on your lefthand panel. <br/>

    Now, scroll down and select "Tokens".

    This will take you to a page that has a "+ Delivery Tokens" button. Click that, and enter a name and description for your new API keys.

    Select the proper branch you're working from and your production environment (you may need to also create a production environment). Then click "Generate Token". 

    If successful, you should see something like this:
